abstract = {AbstractObservational and model resolution limitations currently preclude analysis of the smallest scales important to numerical prediction of convective storms. These missing scales can be recovered if the forecast model is integrated on a sufficiently fine grid, but not before errors are introduced that subsequently grow in scale and magnitude. This study is the first to systematically evaluate the impact of these initial-condition (IC) resolution errors on high-resolution forecasts of organized convection. This is done by comparing high-resolution supercell simulations generated using identical model settings but successively coarsened ICs. Consistent with the Warn-on-Forecast paradigm, the simulations are initialized with ongoing storms and integrated for 2 h. Both idealized and full-physics experiments are performed in order to examine how more realistic model settings modulate the error evolution.In all experiments, scales removed from the IC (wavelengths {\textless} 2, 4, 8, or 16 km) regenerate within 10â€“20...},
