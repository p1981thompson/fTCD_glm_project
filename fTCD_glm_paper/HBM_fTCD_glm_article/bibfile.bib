abstract = {Functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD) adds to the techniques of functional imaging. fTCD measures cerebral perfusion changes related to neural activation in a way comparable to functional magnetic resonance tomography. fTCD contends itself with comparison of averaged, event-related blood flow velocity changes within the territories of two cerebral arteries, for example the left versus the right middle cerebral artery. It can thus serve to evaluate the functional lateralization of higher cognitive functions like hemispheric language dominance (HLD). We present typical applications of fTCD by summarizing studies employing the technique. Then, the physical and physiological underpinnings of fTCD are reviewed. After a brief description of a prototype paradigm for assessing HLD, a detailed outline of the fTCD data analysis is presented. Caveats for fTCD, like other functional imaging techniques, are that the validity of results depends on adequate control of the task parameters, particularly cooperation and reference conditions. We complete the review with examinations of the reliability and validity of the fTCD technique. We conclude that fTCD can be employed to substitute the invasive amobarbital procedure to determine language lateralization in individual patients before undergoing brain surgery. Because of its easy applicability, robustness and mobility, fTCD can also be used to examine many subjects (including children) to obtain representative data on the variability of lateralization of higher cognitive functions, or to scan for atypical patterns of lateralization. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The regulation of blood flow was very rapid; only 2.3 seconds elapsed from application of the light stimulus to 50{\%} of full response. Full regulation (90{\%} of full response) took 4.6 seconds.

abstract = {By using blocked and rapid event-related functional MRI studies of memory, we explored the implications of using rest periods as a baseline condition in functional MRI studies. Activity in the medial temporal lobe (as well as in other brain regions) was substantially higher during rest than during several alternative baseline conditions. The effect of this elevated activity during rest was to reduce, eliminate, or even reverse the sign of the activity during task conditions relevant to memory functions. The results demonstrate that periods of rest are associated with significant cognitive activity and, therefore, provide a nonoptimal baseline for memory tasks. These results were observed not only when relatively long blocks of rest were used (experiment 1), but also when rest consisted of the short null trials typically used in rapid event-related designs (experiment 2). The findings have important implications for the design and interpretation of a wide range of fMRI studies of cognition.},

@article{Binder2008,
abstract = {AIMS: Many fMRI protocols for localizing speech comprehension have been described, but there has been little quantitative comparison of these methods. We compared five such protocols in terms of areas activated, extent of activation, and lateralization. METHODS: fMRI BOLD signals were measured in 26 healthy adults during passive listening and active tasks using words and tones. Contrasts were designed to identify speech perception and semantic processing systems. Activation extent and lateralization were quantified by counting activated voxels in each hemisphere for each participant. RESULTS: Passive listening to words produced bilateral superior temporal activation. After controlling for prelinguistic auditory processing, only a small area in the left superior temporal sulcus responded selectively to speech. Active tasks engaged an extensive, bilateral attention, and executive processing network. Optimal results (consistent activation and strongly lateralized pattern) were obtained by contrasting an active semantic decision task with a tone decision task. There was striking similarity between the network of brain regions activated by the semantic task and the network of brain regions that showed task-induced deactivation, suggesting that semantic processing occurs during the resting state. CONCLUSIONS: fMRI protocols for mapping speech comprehension systems differ dramatically in pattern, extent, and lateralization of activation. Brain regions involved in semantic processing were identified only when an active, nonlinguistic task was used as a baseline, supporting the notion that semantic processing occurs whenever attentional resources are not controlled. Identification of these lexical-semantic regions is particularly important for predicting language outcome in patients undergoing temporal lobe surgery.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Cerebral vascular territories are of key clinical importance in patients with stroke, but available maps are highly variable and based on prior studies with small sample sizes. OBJECTIVE To update and improve the state of knowledge on the supratentorial vascular supply to the brain by using the natural experiment of large artery infarcts and to map out the variable anatomy of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral artery (ACA, MCA, and PCA) territories. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study, digital maps of supratentorial infarcts were generated using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 1160 patients with acute ({\textless}1-week) stroke recruited (May 2011 to February 2013) consecutively from 11 Korean stroke centers. All had supratentorial infarction associated with significant stenosis or occlusion of 1 of 3 large supratentorial cerebral arteries but with patent intracranial or extracranial carotid arteries. Data were analyzed between February 2016 and August 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The 3 vascular territories were mapped individually by affected vessel, generating 3 data sets for which infarct frequency is defined for each voxel in the data set. By mapping these 3 vascular territories collectively, we generated data sets showing the Certainty Index (CI) to reflect the likelihood of a voxel being a member of a specific vascular territory, calculated as either ACA, MCA, or PCA infarct frequency divided by total infarct frequency in that voxel. RESULTS Of the 1160 patients (mean [SD] age, 67.0 [13.3] years old), 623 were men (53.7{\%}). When the cutoff CI was set as 90{\%}, the volume of the MCA territory (approximately 54{\%} of the supratentorial parenchymal brain volume) was about 4-fold bigger than the volumes of the ACA and PCA territories (each approximately 13{\%}). Quantitative studies showed that the medial frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and anterior cingulate were involved mostly in ACA infarcts, whereas the middle frontal gyrus and caudate were involved mostly by MCA infarcts. The PCA infarct territory was smaller and narrower than traditionally shown. Border-zone maps could be defined by using either relative infarct frequencies or CI differences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We have generated statistically rigorous maps to delineate territorial border zones and lines. The new topographic brain atlas can be used in clinical care and in research to objectively define the supratentorial arterial territories and their borders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) can guide and complement investigations based on functional magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography imaging by providing continuous information on cerebral perfusion changes correlated to cerebral activation. So far, however, the role of functional TCD has been limited by a lack of sensitivity. METHODS: Here, the authors present an outline of a method that increases the potential of TCD to detect perfusion changes within a vascular territory. Sensitivity on the order of 1{\%} can be achieved by transformation of Doppler envelope curves, which accounts for systemic quasi-periodic and irregular spontaneous blood flow modulations and artificial disturbances related to the recording. A statistical technique is introduced that allows the automatic detection of time periods of significant hemispheric lateralization in evoked flow studies. Furthermore, an index of laterality is defined quantifying the extent of hemispheric dominance during stimulus processing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The analysis technique described in this article has been successfully employed in recent examinations on vision, motor activation, language, language recovery, and other cognitive tasks. CONCLUSION: The novel functional TCD technique permits valid and reproducible assessments of the temporal characteristics of functional hemispheric lateralization.},

Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), a broadly available and easily applicable method that is not hampered by side effects, such as radiation, is a valuable tool for routine examinations. However, standard TCD values of the ventricular system are lacking. In this study, we performed TCD through the temporal acoustic bone window in a large cohort of 1693 healthy children. Of these, 157 had to be excluded because of insufficient bone windows. In the remaining children, a mean width of 1.4 ± 0.8 mm for the third ventricle, 14.4 ± 0.8 mm for the right and 14.6 ± 0.7 mm for the left cella media, and 1.6 ± 0.7 mm for the right and 1.9 ± 0.8 mm for the left temporal horn were measured. Side differences are indicated and values are given in relation to age and gender.

abstract = {Background: The contribution of cerebrovascular function to cognitive performance is gaining increased attention. Transcranial doppler (TCD) is portable, reliable, inexpensive and extremely well tolerated by young and clinical samples. It enables measurement of blood flow velocity in major cerebral arteries at rest and during cognitive tasks. Methods: We systematically reviewed evidence for associations between cognitive performance and cerebrovascular function in children (0-18 years), as measured using TCD. A total of 2778 articles were retrieved from PsychInfo, Pubmed, and EMBASE searches and 25 relevant articles were identified. Results: Most studies investigated clinical groups, where decreased blood flow velocities in infants were associated with poor neurological functioning, and increased blood flow velocities in children with Sickle cell disease were typically associated with cognitive impairment and lower intelligence. Studies were also identified assessing autistic behaviour, mental retardation and sleep disordered breathing. In healthy children, the majority of studies reported cognitive processing produced lateralised changes in blood flow velocities however these physiological responses did not appear to correlate with behavioural cognitive performance. Conclusion: Poor cognitive performance appears to be associated with decreased blood flow velocities in premature infants, and increased velocities in Sickle cell disease children using TCD methods. However knowledge in healthy samples is relatively limited. The technique is well tolerated by children, is portable and inexpensive. It therefore stands to make a valuable contribution to knowledge regarding the underlying functional biology of cognitive performance in childhood.},

abstract = {Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography allows the non-invasive assessment of cerebral haemodynamics. Data on the frequency distribution of these parameters in the oldest old are scarce, which makes a distinction between physiological and pathophysiological ageing difficult. We studied the relation between cerebral haemodynamic parameters and age and sex in 1,720 participants of a population-based study by means of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. The end-diastolic, peak systolic and mean cerebral blood flow velocity, and cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity declined significantly with increasing age up to 90 years (per year -0.6 cm/s; -0.3 cm/s; -0.5 cm/s, and -0.6{\%}/kPa, respectively). The pulsatility index increased with age (per year 0.01). End-diastolic, peak systolic and mean cerebral blood flow velocities were lower in men compared to women (age-adjusted difference 1.6 cm/s; 4.1 cm/s, and 2.5 cm/s, respectively). Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was higher in men compared to women. Adjusting for carotid atherosclerosis did not change the observed sex differences. These findings provide insight into physiologic changes of haemodynamics during ageing and may serve as a starting point for investigations on determinants of pathophysiologic changes in cerebral haemodynamics in the elderly.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose--Functional transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (fTCD) can assess event-related changes in cerebral blood flow velocities and, by comparison between sides, can provide a measure of hemispheric perfusional lateralization. It is easily applicable, insensitive to movement artifacts, and can be used in patients with less than perfect cooperation. In the present study we investigated the validity of fTCD in determining the hemispheric dominance for language by direct comparison of fTCD with intracarotid amobarbital anesthesia (Wada test). Methods--fTCD and the Wada test were performed in 19 patients evaluated for epilepsy surgery. By the Wada test, 13 patients were classified as left-hemisphere dominant and 6 as right-hemisphere dominant for language. fTCD was based on the continuous bilateral measurements of blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral arteries and event-related averaging during a cued word generation task previously shown to activate lateralized language areas in normal adults. Results--In 4 patients fTCD assessment was not possible because of lack of an acoustic temporal bone window. In the remaining 15 candidates, determination of language dominance was concordant with the Wada test in every case. Moreover, the correlation of the lateralization measures from both procedures was highly significant (r=.92, P{\textless}.0001). Conclusions--This strong correlation validates fTCD as a noninvasive and practical tool for the determination of language lateralization that can be applied for clinical and investigative purposes.},

abstract = {Since its introduction, functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD) has been extensively applied in research and clinical settings and has now become part of the routine presurgical work-up of patients with epilepsy. Because of its importance in planning neurosurgical interventions and predicting possible cognitive risks, the reproducibility of fTCD in determining hemispheric language lateralization (HLL) has to be ensured. In the present study, fTCD was performed twice in 33 initially lateralized patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) as part of their presurgical work-up, using a standard word generation paradigm. Initially, the standard analysis, including only the statistical examination of fTCD data, was applied, and a rather poor retest reliability of r = 0.41 was obtained (p = 0.017). Because of doubts concerning appropriate task performance in some patients, subsequently, a two-step data analysis was introduced, including an additional qualitative evaluation of fTCD data regarding (1) instruction-compliant task performance, (2) sufficient quality of the baseline phase, and (3) adequate increase in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) during the activation phase. Attributable to a more valid interpretation of fTCD data after the application of the qualitative step, the reproducibility of HLL significantly improved (p = 0.007) to a high retest reliability of r = 0.84 (p {\textless} 0.000). In clinical settings, psychological and situational factors seem to strongly influence the reproducibility of fTCD determining HLL. Accordingly, we highly recommend the complementation of the standard statistical examination of fTCD data by an additional qualitative evaluation (two-step data analysis), as this extra security is particularly desirable because of its direct implications for the further evaluation of neurosurgical interventions.

Perfusion differences and their time course within two different arteries can be analyzed by parametric and non parametric statistical methods. This is important, for instance, in studies on hemispherical dominance during mental task processing. Each data processing step is supported by graphical output. If investigated bilaterally with interhemispheric analysis even minimal activations can reliably be detected and quantified with a sensitivity known from positron emission tomography approaches.},

abstract = {Functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD) is a useful medical imaging technique to monitor cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in major cerebral arteries. In this paper, CBFV changes in the right and left middle cerebral arteries (MCA) caused by cognitive tasks, such as word generation tasks and mental rotation tasks, were examined using fTCD. CBFV recordings were collected from 20 healthy subjects (10 females, 10 males). We obtained both the raw CBFV signal and the envelope CBFV signal, which is the maximal velocity to gain more information about the changes and hemisphere lateralization in cognitive tasks compared to the resting state. Time, frequency, time-frequency, and information-theoretic features were calculated and compared. Sex effects were also taken into consideration. The results of our analysis demonstrated that the raw CBFV signal contained more descriptive information than the envelope signals. Furthermore, both types of cognitive tasks produced higher values in most signal features. Geometric tasks were more distinguished from the rest-state than verbal tasks and the lateralization was exhibited in right MCA during geometric tasks. Our results show that the raw CBFV signals provided valuable information when studying the effects of cognitive tasks and lateralization in the MCA.},

FTCD estimates the blood flow velocity in the cerebral arteries from which, neural activity is inferred. The review provides a brief history and introduction to fTCD, including data acquisition, task design, and data processing. Challenges and solutions for the use of fTCD for language research are covered, reporting on production and comprehension paradigms, task difficulty and behavioural performance during covert and overt speech production, and participant characteristics (age and sex). We note the limited application of fTCD to the topic of spoken language understanding, commenting on the value of examining lateralisation in this endeavour, as well as the advantages of its use, namely portability and low cost, to supplement other imaging techniques.},

abstract = {Studies to date that have used fTCD to examine language lateralisation have predominantly used word or sentence generation tasks. Here we sought to further assess the sensitivity of fTCD to language lateralisation by using a metalinguistic task which does not involve novel speech generation: rhyme judgement in response to written words. Line array judgement was included as a non-linguistic visuospatial task to examine the relative strength of left and right hemisphere lateralisation within the same individuals when output requirements of the tasks are matched. These externally paced tasks allowed us to manipulate the number of stimuli presented to participants and thus assess the influence of pace on the strength of lateralisation.In Experiment 1, 28 right-handed adults participated in rhyme and line array judgement tasks and showed reliable left and right lateralisation at the group level for each task, respectively. In Experiment 2 we increased the pace of the tasks, presenting more stimuli per trial. We measured laterality indices (LIs) from 18 participants who performed both linguistic and non-linguistic judgement tasks during the original 'slow' presentation rate (5 judgements per trial) and a fast presentation rate (10 judgements per trial). The increase in pace led to increased strength of lateralisation in both the rhyme and line conditions.Our results demonstrate for the first time that fTCD is sensitive to the left lateralised processes involved in metalinguistic judgements. Our data also suggest that changes in the strength of language lateralisation, as measured by fTCD, are not driven by articulatory demands alone. The current results suggest that at least one aspect of task difficulty, the pace of stimulus presentation, influences the strength of lateralisation during both linguistic and non-linguistic tasks.},

@article{Bishop2010,
abstract = {There are many unanswered questions about cerebral lateralization. In particular, it remains unclear which aspects of language and nonverbal ability are lateralized, whether there are any disadvantages associated with atypical patterns of cerebral lateralization, and whether cerebral lateralization develops with age. In the past, researchers interested in these questions tended to use handedness as a proxy measure for cerebral lateralization, but this is unsatisfactory because handedness is only a weak and indirect indicator of laterality of cognitive functions. Other methods, such as fMRI, are expensive for large-scale studies, and not always feasible with children. Here we will describe the use of functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD) as a cost-effective, non-invasive and reliable method for assessing cerebral lateralization. The procedure involves measuring blood flow in the middle cerebral artery via an ultrasound probe placed just in front of the ear. Our work builds on work by Rune Aaslid, who co-introduced TCD in 1982, and Stefan Knecht, Michael Deppe and their colleagues at the University of M{\"{u}}nster, who pioneered the use of simultaneous measurements of left- and right middle cerebral artery blood flow, and devised a method of correcting for heart beat activity. This made it possible to see a clear increase in left-sided blood flow during language generation, with lateralization agreeing well with that obtained using other methods. The middle cerebral artery has a very wide vascular territory (see Figure 1) and the method does not provide useful information about localization within a hemisphere. Our experience suggests it is particularly sensitive to tasks that involve explicit or implicit speech production. The 'gold standard' task is a word generation task (e.g. think of as many words as you can that begin with the letter 'B'), but this is not suitable for young children and others with limited literacy skills. Compared with other brain imaging methods, fTCD is relatively unaffected by movement artefacts from speaking, and so we are able to get a reliable result from tasks that involve describing pictures aloud. Accordingly, we have developed a child-friendly task that involves looking at video-clips that tell a story, and then describing what was seen.},

The aim of this paper is to show how a time-locked correlation-analysis of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) lateralization data, obtained with functional TransCranial Doppler (fTCD) ultrasound, can be used to infer cerebral activation patterns across tasks. In a first experiment we demonstrate that the proposed analysis method results in data that are comparable with the standard Lateralization Index (LI) for within-task comparisons of CBFV patterns, recorded during cued word generation (CWG) at two difficulty levels. In the main experiment we demonstrate that the proposed analysis method shows correlated blood-flow patterns for two different cognitive tasks that are known to draw on common brain areas, CWG, and Music Synthesis. We show that CBFV patterns for Music and CWG are correlated only for participants with prior musical training. CBFV patterns for tasks that draw on distinct brain areas, the Tower of London and CWG, are not correlated. The proposed methodology extends conventional fTCD analysis by including temporal information in the analysis of cerebral blood-flow patterns to provide a robust, non-invasive method to infer whether common brain areas are used in different cognitive tasks. It complements conventional high resolution imaging techniques.},

The left CBFV asymmetry measure (PSV or MV) was calculated by subtracting the right-side value from the left-side value.

abstract = {Repeated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during learning and recovery can inform us about functional reorganization in the brain. We examined how, in the absence of reorganization, simple task repetition affects measures of fMRI activation. We studied fMRI activation over 10 consecutive sessions of silent word generation in a healthy subject. Additionally, we performed functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD) to learn about the temporal pattern of corresponding changes in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and pulsatility. With repetition, word generation-associated increases in heart rate diminished steadily. Task repetition also led to a net increase in CBFV bilaterally and to a bilateral increase in the number of activated voxels on fMRI. As a result, whereas the absolute interhemispheric difference of activated voxels remained constant, there was a decrease in the standard fMRI index for language lateralization [LIfMRI = 100 (activated voxels in left hemisphere - voxels in right)/(voxels in left + voxels in right)]. Thus task repetition can lead to changes in task-related autonomic drive and an augmentation of bihemispheric blood flow. This can mimic increasing bilaterality of brain activation.},

In particular we model evoked responses, and their differences, in terms of basis functions of the peri-stimulus time. This facilitates a characterization of the temporal response profiles that has a high effective temporal resolution relative to the repetition time. To demonstrate the technique we examined differential responses to visually presented words that had been seen prior to scanning or that were novel.

abstract = {The temporal characteristics of the BOLD response in sensorimotor and auditory cortices were measured in subjects performing finger tapping while listening to metronome pacing tones. A repeated trial paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s and intertrial times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to be nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not be predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a rectangular function. In the short-time regime, the amplitude of the response varied only slowly with stimulus duration. It was found that this character was predicted with a modification to Buxton's balloon model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur the response to concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual rates. Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the response to fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The deconvolution filter must be measured for each subject using a short-stimulus paradigm. It is concluded that deconvolution may be effective in diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal blurring and may have potential applications in quantitating responses in event-related fMRI.},

Second, responses to long-duration stimuli can be predicted from responses to shorter duration stimuli. Third, the noise in the fMRI data is independent of stimulus contrast and temporal period. Although these tests can not prove the correctness of the linear transform model, they might have been used to reject the model.

abstract = {Activation detection in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) typically assumes the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity to be invariant across brain regions and subjects. Reports of substantial variability of the morphology of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses are accumulating, suggesting that the use of a single generic model of the expected response in general linear model (GLM) analyses does not provide optimal sensitivity due to model misspecification. Relaxing assumptions of the model can limit the impact of hemodynamic response function (HRF) variability, but at a cost on model parsimony. Alternatively, better specification of the model could be obtained from a priori knowledge of the HRF of a given subject, but the effectiveness of this approach has only been tested on simulation data. Using fast BOLD fMRI, we characterized the variability of hemodynamic responses to a simple event-related auditory-motor task, as well as its effect on activation detection with GLM analyses. We show the variability to be higher between subjects than between regions and variation in different regions to correlate from one subject to the other. Accounting for subject-related variability by deriving subject-specific models from responses to the task in some regions lead to more sensitive detection of responses in other regions. We applied the approach to epilepsy patients, where task-derived patient-specific models provided additional information compared to the use of a generic model for the detection of BOLD responses to epileptiform activity identified on scalp electro-encephalogram (EEG). This work highlights the importance of improving the accuracy of the model for detecting neuronal activation with fMRI, and the fact that it can be done at no cost to model parsimony through the acquisition of independent a priori information about the hemodynamic response. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = "Activation detection in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) typically assumes the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity to be invariant across brain regions and subjects. Reports of substantial variability of the morphology of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses are accumulating, suggesting that the use of a single generic model of the expected response in general linear model (GLM) analyses does not provide optimal sensitivity due to model misspecification. Relaxing assumptions of the model can limit the impact of hemodynamic response function (HRF) variability, but at a cost on model parsimony. Alternatively, better specification of the model could be obtained from a priori knowledge of the HRF of a given subject, but the effectiveness of this approach has only been tested on simulation data. Using fast BOLD fMRI, we characterized the variability of hemodynamic responses to a simple event-related auditory-motor task, as well as its effect on activation detection with GLM analyses. We show the variability to be higher between subjects than between regions and variation in different regions to correlate from one subject to the other. Accounting for subject-related variability by deriving subject-specific models from responses to the task in some regions lead to more sensitive detection of responses in other regions. We applied the approach to epilepsy patients, where task-derived patient-specific models provided additional information compared to the use of a generic model for the detection of BOLD responses to epileptiform activity identified on scalp electro-encephalogram (EEG). This work highlights the importance of improving the accuracy of the model for detecting neuronal activation with fMRI, and the fact that it can be done at no cost to model parsimony through the acquisition of independent a priori information about the hemodynamic response."

abstract = "Most brain research to date have focused on studying the amplitude of evoked fMRI responses, though there has recently been an increased interest in measuring onset, peak latency and duration of the responses as well. A number of modeling procedures provide measures of the latency and duration of fMRI responses. In this work we compare several techniques that vary in their assumptions, model complexity, and interpretation. For each method, we introduce methods for estimating amplitude, peak latency, and duration and for performing inference in a multi-subject fMRI setting. We then assess the techniques' relative sensitivity and their propensity for mis-attributing task effects on one parameter (e.g., duration) to another (e.g., amplitude). Finally, we introduce methods for quantifying model misspecification and assessing bias and power-loss related to the choice of model. Overall, the results show that it is surprisingly difficult to accurately recover true task-evoked changes in BOLD signal and that there are substantial differences among models in terms of power, bias and parameter confusability. Because virtually all fMRI studies in cognitive and affective neuroscience employ these models, the results bear on the interpretation of hemodynamic response estimates across a wide variety of psychological and neuroscientific studies."

 abstract = {In recent years there has been explosive growth in the number of neuroimaging studies performed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The field that has grown around the acquisition and analysis of fMRI data is intrinsically interdisciplinary in nature and involves contributions from researchers in neuroscience, psychology, physics and statistics, among others. A standard fMRI study gives rise to massive amounts of noisy data with a complicated spatio-temporal correlation structure. Statistics plays a crucial role in understanding the nature of the data and obtaining relevant results that can be used and interpreted by neuroscientists. In this paper we discuss the analysis of fMRI data, from the initial acquisition of the raw data to its use in locating brain activity, making inference about brain connectivity and predictions about psychological or disease states. Along the way, we illustrate interesting and important issues where statistics already plays a crucial role. We also seek to illustrate areas where statistics has perhaps been underutilized and will have an increased role in the future.},

abstract = "While many advanced mixed-effects models have been proposed and are used in fMRI, the simplest, ordinary least squares (OLS), is still the one that is most widely used. A survey of 90 papers found that 92% of group fMRI analyses used OLS. Despite the widespread use, this simple approach has never been thoroughly justified and evaluated; for example, the typical reference for the method is a conference abstract, (Holmes, A., Friston, K., 1998. Generalisability, random effects & population inference. NeuroImage 7 (4 (2/3)), S754, proceedings of Fourth International Conference on Functional Mapping of the Human Brain, June 7–12, 1998, Montreal, Canada.), which has been referenced over 400 times. In this work we fully derive the simplified method in a general setting and carefully identify the homogeneity assumptions it is based on. We examine the specificity (Type I error rate) of the OLS method under heterogeneity in the one-sample case and find that the OLS method is valid, with only slight conservativeness. Surprisingly, a Satterthwaite approximation for effective degrees of freedom only makes the method more conservative, instead of more accurate. While other authors have highlighted the inferior power of the OLS method relative to optimal mixed-effects methods under heterogeneity, we revisit these results and find the power differences very modest. While statistical methods that make the best use of the data are always to be preferred, software or other practical concerns may require the use of the simple OLS group modeling. In such cases, we find that group mean inferences will be valid under the null hypothesis and will have nearly optimal sensitivity under the alternative."

It is commonly believed that orthogonalizing collinear regressors in the model will solve this problem, and some software packages apply automatic orthogonalization. However, the effects of orthogonalization on the interpretation of the resulting parameter estimates is widely unappreciated or misunderstood. Here we discuss the nature and causes of collinearity in fMRI models, with a focus on the appropriate uses of orthogonalization. Special attention is given to how the two popular fMRI data analysis software packages, SPM and FSL, handle orthogonalization, and pitfalls that may be encountered in their usage. Strategies are discussed for reducing collinearity in fMRI designs and addressing their effects when they occur.},

@phdthesis{Bruckert2016,
abstract = {It is well known that language processing depends on specialized areas in the left side of the brain in the majority of the population. A popular view is that developmental language disorders result from a poorly lateralized brain, but evidence in support of this has been weak and inconsistent. In this thesis, I investigated language-related asymmetries in brain structure and function, and their behavioural relevance in both individuals with specific language impairment (SLI) and typically developing adults. Combining different brain imaging techniques, I looked at group-level as well as individual estimates of language laterality and its relationship to language abilities. The aim of my first two studies was to investigate the neural underpinnings of SLI in terms of white matter microstructure and functional organization associated with auditory processing. For this, diffusion and functional MRI data was obtained in a small number of families with a history of SLI and in control families. Compared with neurotypical controls, children with SLI had lower white matter integrity in the corpus callosum, and in white matter areas corresponding to the dorsal and ventral language pathways. The expected functional lateralization for auditory processing was not observed in either group. In the second half of my thesis, I assessed language laterality in 215 neurotypical adults. I demonstrated that functional transcranial Doppler (FTCD) ultrasonography could reliably assess functional lateralization across different language processes. From this large group, I identified 16 individuals with atypical language lateralization and compared them to a group of 16 typically lateralized individuals using a combination of FTCD, MRI and behavioural measures of language laterality and language abilities. The two groups differed significantly in terms of lateralization assessed by functional MRI and diffusion imaging. The atypical group had lower left and greater right hemisphere activation compared with the typical group, and lacked the leftwards asymmetry in the ventral language tract seen in the typical group. The groups did not differ in terms of cognitive measures. Different functional laterality assessments were concordant in the typically lateralized individuals but were inconsistent in the individuals assessed as atypical by FTCD. In brief, my findings suggest that for some individuals language lateralization may be unstable and varies depending on task or other factors. Even so, such differences do not appear to have consequences for language or other cognitive development.},
